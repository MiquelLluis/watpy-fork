    "Second, we need a `simulation_name`. This is more annoying. The name is typically a string that identifies the physical properties of the simulated binary. So far, we have been using names like `MS1b_1.350_1.350_0.00_0.00_0.038_0.291_bigbox` (see e.g. `BAM:0065:R08`) and they can be generated with the function below. This naming convention can be in principle changed when adding a new simulation. **NOTE: the `metadata_main.txt` at the simulation level contains a field `simulation_name` which has a different value of the same field in the `metadata.txt` at the run level (check any repo of the CoRe DB). The value of the former value is the sub-string (initial part) of the latter that is common to all the runs**. Later, we will need to do take care of this manually, so for the moment we will generate TWO names: a long and a short one."
